    "Data science is a powerful tool, but it doesn't always have access to the full picture. In the case of gentrification and its effects on crime, for example, we might rely on county-level data to track trends, but these broader datasets can miss the nuances that are essential for a complete understanding. County-level data may show a decrease in crime rates, but that doesn’t account for the displacement of marginalized communities, the rise in surveillance, or the social upheaval occurring at the neighborhood level. To draw more accurate and truthful conclusions, data scientists need to recognize the gaps in their data and acknowledge the context these numbers exist within. Without considering the underlying social dynamics, such as increased policing, changes in community structure, and economic pressures, the analysis can paint an incomplete picture. Understanding these limitations and the broader context is essential for drawing more accurate insights and making informed, responsible decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To-do: Choose a couple of the counties below and read about how gentrification has impacted them. Then, use the widget above to explore the data and make observations. How does the historical information provided align with the trends shown? In what ways?\n",
    "\n",
    "### County information\n",
    "1. San Francisco County\n",
    "Gentrification Start: Early 1990s\n",
    "San Francisco’s neighborhoods like the Mission District, Tenderloin, and Bayview-Hunters Point have seen significant gentrification, driven by tech industry growth, especially in the 1990s and 2000s. Rising housing costs and the influx of wealthier residents displaced long-time working-class communities.\n",
    "2. Los Angeles County\n",
    "Gentrification Start: Early 2000s (accelerated in 2010s)\n",
    "Areas such as Downtown LA, Echo Park, Silver Lake, and Highland Park have experienced gentrification as real estate development, rising rents, and an influx of young professionals and artists transformed these historically lower-income, immigrant, and minority communities.\n",
    "3. Oakland (Alameda County)\n",
    "Gentrification Start: Mid-2000s\n",
    "Gentrification in Oakland has been noticeable in neighborhoods like West Oakland, Fruitvale, and Uptown. As housing costs in San Francisco increased, Oakland became a more attractive option for people seeking affordable living, which led to an influx of higher-income residents and subsequent displacement.\n",
    "4. Santa Clara County (San Jose)\n",
    "Gentrification Start: Early 2000s\n",
    "With the tech boom in Silicon Valley, areas around downtown San Jose and the surrounding cities have experienced significant gentrification, particularly from the 2000s onward. The rising demand for housing due to the tech industry has led to displacement in lower-income, predominantly Latino communities.\n",
    "5. San Diego County\n",
    "Gentrification Start: Mid-2000s\n",
    "Areas such as North Park, Logan Heights, and Barrio Logan have been gentrifying as rising property values, especially along the coast and near downtown, have drawn wealthier residents into traditionally working-class Latino neighborhoods. This process accelerated in the 2010s as San Diego’s real estate market grew.\n",
    "6. Sacramento County\n",
    "Gentrification Start: 2010s\n",
    "Sacramento has seen gentrification in neighborhoods such as Oak Park, Midtown, and the River District, as both the state capital’s economy and the overall housing market in the region have improved. With rising rents and the development of new housing and businesses, long-time residents have faced displacement.\n",
    "7. Riverside County\n",
    "Gentrification Start: Mid-2010s\n",
    "Although not as well-known for gentrification as coastal areas, Riverside and its neighboring cities, like Moreno Valley, have begun experiencing gentrification as people seek more affordable housing compared to LA. New developments and rising rent prices are pushing lower-income communities out of these areas.\n",
    "8. Ventura County\n",
    "Gentrification Start: Early 2000s\n",
    "Cities such as Oxnard and Ventura have experienced gentrification, particularly as housing prices in the surrounding Los Angeles area increased, prompting people to move further out. The transformation has been particularly visible in urban areas that were once more affordable to working-class Latino families."
