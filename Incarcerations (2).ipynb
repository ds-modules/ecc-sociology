    "## Intro\n",
    "The War on Drugs disproportionately impacted people of color, particularly Black Americans, despite their relatively small share of the overall U.S. population. While drug use rates are similar across racial groups, harsh policies—like mandatory minimum sentences and crack cocaine laws—targeted urban communities where Black and Latino populations were concentrated. As a result, Black individuals faced drug-related incarceration at significantly higher rates than white individuals. Despite making up only about 13% of the U.S. population, Black people have historically accounted for a disproportionate percentage of drug arrests and incarcerations. This racial disparity wasn’t just a coincidence—it was fueled by systemic biases in policing, sentencing, and media portrayals that criminalized Black communities at a much higher rate than their white counterparts.\n",

    "### Crack vs Powder Cocaine\n",
    "The War on Drugs, launched in the 1970s and intensified in the 1980s, led to a surge in drug arrests by 1990 due to harsh federal policies like the Anti-Drug Abuse Acts of 1986 and 1988, which imposed mandatory minimum sentences and created a 100:1 sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine, disproportionately affecting Black communities. The Bush administration expanded \"tough on crime\" policing, including Operation Pipeline, which increased drug-related stops and arrests. Law enforcement shifted focus to street-level drug offenses, targeting users and low-level dealers rather than major traffickers. The rise of three-strikes laws and harsher sentencing further drove up incarceration rates. Meanwhile, media-fueled fears of a “crack epidemic” reinforced racialized policing and political rhetoric, justifying aggressive drug enforcement. As a result, 1990 saw a spike in drug possession arrests, particularly among minorities, contributing to the long-term trend of mass incarceration in the U.S.\n",

    "## 90's Drug Arrest Drop \n",
    "In the early 1990s, law enforcement in California and across the U.S. shifted its focus from low-level drug offenses to violent crime and gang-related activity. This change was largely driven by growing concerns over public safety and rising crime rates, leading to policies that prioritized harsher sentencing for repeat offenders. The 1994 Crime Bill played a significant role in this shift by increasing funding for law enforcement and expanding the prison system. Additionally, California’s Three Strikes Law, enacted in 1994, imposed life sentences on individuals convicted of three serious crimes, further redirecting law enforcement efforts toward violent and high-profile offenses. As a result, while drug-related arrests declined, overall incarceration rates remained high due to the crackdown on repeat offenders.\n",

    "# Redlining and Gentrification\n",
    "Redlining and gentrification are interconnected processes that both shape urban landscapes and impact marginalized communities. Redlining, a discriminatory practice where certain neighborhoods, often predominantly inhabited by people of color, were marked as high-risk areas for investment, created long-lasting disparities in housing and economic opportunities. These areas were historically denied access to loans, infrastructure, and public services, leading to cycles of poverty and disinvestment. As gentrification occurs, these once-redlined neighborhoods are targeted for redevelopment, bringing in wealthier, often predominantly white, residents. While gentrification can lead to economic revitalization, it also displaces the lower-income communities that have historically lived in these areas, exacerbating social inequalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gentrification is particularly harmful to marginalized communities because it leads to the displacement of residents, loss of affordable housing, and the erasure of cultural identity. As property values rise and new developments cater to wealthier residents, longtime residents—often people of color—are pushed out of their neighborhoods. This displacement disrupts communities, breaking apart long-established social networks and support systems. The increase in living costs makes it harder for low-income individuals and families to stay in the area, leading to increased economic stress. Gentrification also brings increased surveillance and policing, often targeting the very communities that are being displaced. This can deepen feelings of marginalization and result in higher rates of criminalization for those left behind\n",

    "Data science is a powerful tool, but it doesn't always have access to the full picture. In the case of gentrification and its effects on crime, for example, we might rely on county-level data to track trends, but these broader datasets can miss the nuances that are essential for a complete understanding. County-level data may show a decrease in crime rates, but that doesn’t account for the displacement of marginalized communities, the rise in surveillance, or the social upheaval occurring at the neighborhood level. To draw more accurate and truthful conclusions, data scientists need to recognize the gaps in their data and acknowledge the context these numbers exist within. Without considering the underlying social dynamics, such as increased policing, changes in community structure, and economic pressures, the analysis can paint an incomplete picture. Understanding these limitations and the broader context is essential for drawing more accurate insights and making informed, responsible decisions.\n",

    "To-do: Choose a couple of the counties below and read about how gentrification has impacted them. Then, use the widget above to explore the data and make observations. How does the historical information provided align with the trends shown? In what ways?\n",
    "\n",
    "### County information\n",
    "1. San Francisco County\n",
    "Gentrification Start: Early 1990s\n",
    "San Francisco’s neighborhoods like the Mission District, Tenderloin, and Bayview-Hunters Point have seen significant gentrification, driven by tech industry growth, especially in the 1990s and 2000s. Rising housing costs and the influx of wealthier residents displaced long-time working-class communities.\n",
    "2. Los Angeles County\n",
    "Gentrification Start: Early 2000s (accelerated in 2010s)\n",
    "Areas such as Downtown LA, Echo Park, Silver Lake, and Highland Park have experienced gentrification as real estate development, rising rents, and an influx of young professionals and artists transformed these historically lower-income, immigrant, and minority communities.\n",
    "3. Oakland (Alameda County)\n",
    "Gentrification Start: Mid-2000s\n",
    "Gentrification in Oakland has been noticeable in neighborhoods like West Oakland, Fruitvale, and Uptown. As housing costs in San Francisco increased, Oakland became a more attractive option for people seeking affordable living, which led to an influx of higher-income residents and subsequent displacement.\n",
    "4. Santa Clara County (San Jose)\n",
    "Gentrification Start: Early 2000s\n",
    "With the tech boom in Silicon Valley, areas around downtown San Jose and the surrounding cities have experienced significant gentrification, particularly from the 2000s onward. The rising demand for housing due to the tech industry has led to displacement in lower-income, predominantly Latino communities.\n",
    "5. San Diego County\n",
    "Gentrification Start: Mid-2000s\n",
    "Areas such as North Park, Logan Heights, and Barrio Logan have been gentrifying as rising property values, especially along the coast and near downtown, have drawn wealthier residents into traditionally working-class Latino neighborhoods. This process accelerated in the 2010s as San Diego’s real estate market grew.\n",
    "6. Sacramento County\n",
    "Gentrification Start: 2010s\n",
    "Sacramento has seen gentrification in neighborhoods such as Oak Park, Midtown, and the River District, as both the state capital’s economy and the overall housing market in the region have improved. With rising rents and the development of new housing and businesses, long-time residents have faced displacement.\n",
    "7. Riverside County\n",
    "Gentrification Start: Mid-2010s\n",
    "Although not as well-known for gentrification as coastal areas, Riverside and its neighboring cities, like Moreno Valley, have begun experiencing gentrification as people seek more affordable housing compared to LA. New developments and rising rent prices are pushing lower-income communities out of these areas.\n",
    "8. Ventura County\n",
    "Gentrification Start: Early 2000s\n",
    "Cities such as Oxnard and Ventura have experienced gentrification, particularly as housing prices in the surrounding Los Angeles area increased, prompting people to move further out. The transformation has been particularly visible in urban areas that were once more affordable to working-class Latino families."
